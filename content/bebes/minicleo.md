Too much direct light in warmer months may burn the foliage. Still, set indoor plants outside at least once a year in direct sunlight to encourage lush growth.

#### :point_up:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-pot
If intended as a houseplant, choose a deep pot with many drainage holes. Fill the bottom third with peaty potting soil and establish a stake gently for the stem to climb on. Set the roots into the container. Fill with soil around the roots. Firmly surround the stake with soil and use plant ties to attach the stem to the stake.

Every two years or so, the Monstera deliciosa will likely outgrow its pot.

Transplant into a pot a few inches wider and deeper.

</br></br>
