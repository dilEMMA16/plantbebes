#### :sunny:  &nbsp; Sun
Bright indirect light?

This plant is relatively durable and it can thrive in many different conditions but it is more suited to bright light but not direct sun. It can, however, cope with low light.

</br></br>

#### :ocean:  &nbsp; Water
If terracotta = 1-2 / week

No completely dry soil

Through Spring and Summer the soil should be kept moist but during winter the soil should be allowed to dry out between waterings.

</br></br>

#### :seedling:  &nbsp; Soil
Well-draining, well-aerated

Likes moist not soggy soil

Maybe switch to a non terracotta pot - might be wicking away excess water that is beneficial

</br></br>

#### :yum:  &nbsp; Fertilizer
Should be fed every month during spring and summer, especially when new leaves are growing. During the winter, feeding can take place every other month using a basic houseplant food

</br></br>

#### :droplet: &nbsp; &nbsp; Humidity
This species is quite tolerant of dry conditions. During summer it's good practice to mist the leaves.

#### :point_up:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-pot
When the roots compact and form a tight ball it is time for the plant to be repotted into a planter that is around 2-3 inches larger. Repotting should take place during the latter part of winter or spring before the plant begins to grow new leaves.
