*Codiaeum variegatum* | Croton banana
<!--more-->

>Native to Sri Lanka
>
>Wash leaves regularly
>
>There are hundreds of croton varieties, including names like Dreadlocks, Ann Rutherford, Mona Lisa, and Irene Kingsley. For a plant with this incredible diversity, it's amazing that there is only one species (C. variegatum). However, crotons are genetically unstable, so each plant is unique, and interesting varieties are highly prized by enthusiastic collectors.

#### :sunny:  &nbsp; Sun

Bright light to grow colorful leaves but not direct sun or will sunburn

Fav = a bright dappled light

Not enough light = colors and patterns on leaves fade


</br></br>

#### :ocean:  &nbsp; Water
Not enough water? Leaves brown and damp


</br></br>

#### :seedling:  &nbsp; Soil
Standard, well-draining


</br></br>

#### :yum:  &nbsp; Fertilizer
1-2 times per month, especially during active growth in spring and summer


</br></br>

#### :droplet: &nbsp; &nbsp; Humidity

Moderate moisture - too much or too little results in leaf loss

OR LOVE humidity = humidifier or mist

Mist everyday if possible in summer

Low humidity inside the house makes crotons particularly susceptible to spider mites. Mist the plants daily to avoid an infestation.
Humidity, along with the lack of bright light, also affects the color of the leaves.

Keep the humidity level at 40 to 80 percent. If the humidity isn't high enough, the plant may drop some of its leaves. If you have trouble maintaining the humidity in your home at this level, run a humidifier in the room or set a humidity tray beneath the plant and group it with other plants.
