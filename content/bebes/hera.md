> The leaves are recurved, creating a hook shape allowing the plant to anchor itself on other vegetation

>To propagate with Aloe ciliaris stem cuttings
> Cut stems below a node root.

This increases the chance of successful propagation.
Place the cuttings in moist soil.
Keep the soil moist until roots appear and then cut back on watering.
Wait until the top 1″ inch of soil is dry before watering.
Several weeks after planting the cuttings, roots should develop.
Wait several more weeks for the plant to become hardier before transplanting.
Offsets may appear around mature plants, especially when planted in a large container or garden with room for the seeds to se

grows best in full sun

Set it near a window receiving direct sunlight for several hours per day

#### :ocean:  &nbsp; Water
only needs infrequent watering

Water the soil deeply and allow the top 2″ inches to dry completely between watering.
Indoor plants may need watering about once per week during the spring and summer.

In the fall, it can likely go about two weeks without water.

During the winter, water the plant once every three weeks.

#### :seedling:  &nbsp; Soil
grows best in sandy or gravelly soil with good drainage

Using a standard potting mix with extra sand or perlite should create an ideal environment for the plant.

If grown in a container instead of in the ground, the soil needs very good drainage.

Ensure the container has drainage holes and add more sand or perlite to the potting mixture
