#### :sunny:  &nbsp; Sun
Full to partial sun

prefers 6-8 hours of bright light every day. However, it will grow in partial sun if direct light isn’t an option.

When indoors, place your crocodile plant in the sunniest south-facing window you have. Supplement with a grow light if needed

#### :ocean:  &nbsp; Water
Soak and dry method

Aloe brevifolia’s leaves are so chock-full of water that they don’t need frequent watering

Give your short-leaved aloe a deep drink, and then let the soil dry out and remain so for a few days.

Watch for yellowing and mushy leaves, which is a sign of major overwatering. If this happens, repot your Aloe brevifolia in dry soil and lay off the watering can.

Give your short leaved aloe less water during the winter and summer. Too much during this time may cause it to rot

#### :seedling:  &nbsp; Soil
Sandy and fast-draining

</br></br>

#### :yum:  &nbsp; Fertilizer
Optional - balanced liquid fertilizer

Feed your plant 2-3 times during spring and fall. Don’t fertilize during the summer and winter.

</br></br>

#### :droplet: &nbsp; &nbsp; Humidity
Aloe plants are semi arid and will tolerate some humidity but do not require it.

#### :point_up:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-pot
Crocodile plant grows slowly, so you likely won’t have to repot it. However, if your plant does manage to outgrow its container, then it’s time for an upgrade.

Treat your short-leaved aloe to a slightly larger pot and fresh, dry soil. After replanting, let it sit without water for a few days so it can adjust to the move.
