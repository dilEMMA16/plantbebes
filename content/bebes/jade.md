*Crassula ovata* | Jade
<!--more-->

> Many know it as a houseplant, but in warm climates, it actually grows into a shrub.

</br>

#### :sunny:  &nbsp; Sun
Bright indirect, full sun

A southern-facing window is ideal.

</br></br>

#### :ocean:  &nbsp; Water
Low, err toward side of underwatering

To avoid overwatering, soak the plant, allow it to drain completely, then wait for the soil to dry out before watering again.

Reduce watering in late fall - winter = goes semi-dormant during this time

</br></br>

#### :seedling:  &nbsp; Soil
Coarse and sandy


</br></br>

#### :yum:  &nbsp; Fertilizer
¼ strength succulent fertilizer once per month during growing seasons


</br></br>

#### :droplet: &nbsp; &nbsp; Humidity
Prefer low humidity but also survive nicely in very humid climates

#### :point_up:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-pot

#### :triumph:  &nbsp; Mature Height
3-6 ft

</br></br>

#### :fire:  &nbsp; Temperature
Crassula can be sensitive to temperature. Too hot, and they will go dormant and drop their lower leaves—too cold, and they will fail to grow or thrive. Other than that, they tend to tolerate neglect just fine. With all species, you can aggressively cut the plants back whenever they get straggly or leggy.

Some species will tolerate a mild frost, but temperatures below 30 degrees Fahrenheit may be enough to kill them off.
