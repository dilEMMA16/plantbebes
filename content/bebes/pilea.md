*Piliea peperomioides* | Chinese money plant, pancake plant
<!--more-->

> Can be completely self-propagating with pups at base
>
> Ensure doesn’t sit near heating vent in winter - may drop its leaves
>
> If you notice white spots on your Pilea, they are most likely caused by salts and chemicals in your water. If you do not have a filtration system, leaving the tap water in an open container overnight before watering can help remove some of the chlorine and fluoride.

#### :sunny:  &nbsp; Sun
Chases sun - rotate it at least 2-3 times per week to prevent it from growing lopsided

Direct sun bad
Partial to a shady spot and grow well on window sill in winter

Can adapt to lower light but leaves will turn darker green and plant will spread out more

</br></br>

#### :ocean:  &nbsp; Water
1/week when soil completely dry, possibly more during the hot summer months

OR top two inches

Do not like soggy soil

Watch the leaves = when they start looking a tad droopy, it is time to water your plant

</br></br>

#### :seedling:  &nbsp; Soil
well-draining

</br></br>

#### :yum:  &nbsp; Fertilizer
Use a liquid houseplant fertilizer at ½ the recommended strength twice during the spring and summer

</br></br>

#### :droplet: &nbsp; &nbsp; Humidity
Medium

Misting leaves appreciated

Does not require any extra humidity and does well in a drier environment
