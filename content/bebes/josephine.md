*Ficus lyrata* | Fiddle leaf fig

>These plants are native to tropical parts of Africa, where they thrive in very warm and wet conditions. This makes them somewhat challenging for the home grower, who is likely to have trouble duplicating these steamy conditions. However, they are relatively tough plants that can withstand a less-than-perfect environment for a fairly long time.

>Also, every week or two dust the leaves with a damp cloth. Not only does this make the leaves appear shinier and more appealing, but it also allows more sunlight to hit the leaves for photosynthesis. Moreover, you can trim off any damaged or dead leaves as they arise, as they no longer benefit the plant.

>"Ficus" is Latin for "fig" and "lyrata" is Greek for "lyre" (a stringed instrument)

#### :sunny:  &nbsp; Sun
Bright indirect light or medium light

Will burn in direct sun

be prepared to rotate your fiddle-leaf fig every few days so a different part faces the light source. That way, it will grow evenly, rather than lean toward the light.

Cleaning the leaves with a damp cloth or sponge helps remove dust, restore glossy appearance AND improve the photosynthesis efficiency

</br></br>

#### :ocean:  &nbsp; Water
1-2 inches dry before watering

Underwatering causes new leaves to drop

Overwatering - old leaves brown at edges, then completely and drop

Water generously during summer
Soak every week or so

In winter = water only 1-2 weeks and allow to dry completely

</br></br>

#### :seedling:  &nbsp; Soil
Rich, well-draining

</br></br>

#### :yum:  &nbsp; Fertilizer
Feed with water-soluble fertilizer april - sept.

There are fertilizers specially made for fiddle-leaf figs available. You generally won’t have to feed your plant over the winter.

</br></br>

#### :droplet: &nbsp; &nbsp; Humidity
Medium - high

Mist every week or so

Good with normal humidity in winter but a humidifier if artificial heating used

Aim for a humidity level between 30% and 65%. If you need to supplement humidity, mist your plant with clean water in a spray bottle daily. Or you can place it on a tray of pebbles filled with water, as long as the bottom of the pot isn’t touching the water. Plus, fiddle-leaf figs can benefit from being in a room with a humidifier.

#### :point_up:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-pot
Repotting encourages growth = repot every other year

Plan to repot a young fiddle-leaf fig annually every spring. Select a sturdy container that is roughly 2 inches larger in diameter than the existing one. Gently loosen the plant from its current pot, lift it out while supporting its base, and place it in the new pot. Fill in the spaces around the plant with potting mix.

Once the plant is mature, it likely will be too large to repot. In that case, remove the first few inches of soil each spring and replace it with fresh soil.


</br></br>

#### :triumph:  &nbsp; Mature Height
Most indoor specimens reach around 10 feet tall

In the wild, they can reach 50 ft

</br></br>

#### :fire:  &nbsp; Temperature
Avoid drops in temperature below 54F

Very sensitive to cold draughts
