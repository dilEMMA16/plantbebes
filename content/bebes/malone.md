Happiest in medium to bright light

If given too much light, the colors and patterns will fade.  If not enough light, the leaves may become darker green.

Use tepid water and water much less frequently in winter months

Water thoroughly when the top inch to two inches of soil is dry to the touch. Allow the soil to dry out a bit between waterings. Always keep an eye on your plant–if the leaves droop or feel a bit thin, it may also be time to water.
