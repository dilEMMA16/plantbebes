*Alocasia - macrorrhiza* | Elephant ear
<!--more-->

>Even with a short growing season in northern climates, these plants can grow rapidly. In the warm summer months, alocasia can produce a new leaf every week. Each new leaf might be twice the size of the previous week. The leaf shapes can vary from slim arrowheads to wide heart-shaped leaves. They have colorful veins and a variety of textures from thick, waxy, slick, and glossy.
>
>Once the plant is in its dormant period (in the late fall and winter), it will begin resting. The rapid leaf growth will stop and the plant will likely remain as-is throughout the winter season. Continue to care for it, and the rapid growth will return the following growing season.
>
>Leaves and sap contain a skin irritant
>
>Most Alocasia plants can be propagated by clump or rhizome division. Cut off a piece of the underground rhizome and pot it up separately. Keep it warm and moist until new growth begins.

#### :sunny:  &nbsp; Sun
Full sun to part shade

Prefer partial sun but can be planted in full sun provided they are kept well-water

</br></br>

#### :ocean:  &nbsp; Water
Keep elephant ear plants consistently moist. They will survive nicely even if covered by as much as 6 inches of standing water. In other garden locations, never allow the soil to dry out fully. In some climates—and when growing in containers—this means watering daily.

Allow the top few inches of soil to become nearly dry before watering. This will help keep the soil evenly moist. Soggy soil makes the plant susceptible to fungal infections.

Keep Alocasia plants moist all year; they are water-loving plants. There is a fine line with these plants. You want to keep the soil moist, but not soggy. They require less water during the winter months because the plant is dormant.

</br></br>

#### :seedling:  &nbsp; Soil
Elephant ears grow best in a rich, humusy soil that is moist to the point of being wet

Loose, well-draining potting mix or crumbly loam

</br></br>

#### :yum:  &nbsp; Fertilizer
Heavy feeders - use a slow release fertilizer or fertilize often with a well-balanced water soluble fertilizer during growing season

Like many large-leaved tropical plants, elephant ears are heavy feeders. Apply a water-soluble high-nitrogen fertilizer every two to three weeks

</br></br>

#### :droplet: &nbsp; &nbsp; Humidity
They require and thrive in very humid environments. To raise the humidity around your plant, place it on a tray filled with pebbles and then add water until it rises to just below the bottom of the pot

#### :point_up:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-pot
Repot Alocasia varieties annually into larger pots with fresh, free-draining potting soil. Also, it's best to divide the rhizome annually to keep the plant a manageable size and increase your collection.

</br></br>

#### :triumph:  &nbsp; Mature Height
3–8 feet tall, similar spread; smaller in colder climates

</br></br>

#### :fire:  &nbsp; Temperature
Alocasias will suffer below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Some varieties will die back during colder weather and re-sprout from the rhizome

Keep them away from cold drafts from windows, doors, and air conditioning.
