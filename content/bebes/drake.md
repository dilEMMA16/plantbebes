#### :sunny:  &nbsp; Sun
Low to medium = will grow more slowly and need less water

In bright indirect = be sure to keep the plant well-watered to avoid wilting

Too little light will result in the leaves losing their color variegation and might stunt the plant's growth. Exposure to direct sun can burn the plant and cause it to wilt.

#### :ocean:  &nbsp; Water
Allow to slightly dry between watering they do not like to be constantly wet

Overwatering → root rot

Keep the soil evenly moist but not soggy during the growing season (spring to fall). Reduce watering in the late fall to winter.

However, never let the soil completely dry out. Soil that is too wet or too dry can cause leaf tips to dry out and turn brown.

Moreover, like other Dracaena species, corn plants are sensitive to fluoride and boron, which can be found in tap water. Thus, it's best to use distilled water to avoid leaf tip burn, stunted growth, and even plant death.
