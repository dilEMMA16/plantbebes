*peperomia ginny* | Tri-color plants
<!--more-->

> Description? Did you knows?

</br>

#### :sunny:  &nbsp; Sun
Happiest in medium to bright light

No direct sun

Can tolerate lower light as well and can even adapt to fluorescent lighting

</br></br>

#### :ocean:  &nbsp; Water
Water thoroughly and allow the soil to dry out a bit between waterings

Can effectively hold water in stems and leaves and are therefore quite forgiving

In fact, overwatering is a common issue amongst Peperomia owners. To avoid root rot, aim to water your Tricolor plant every ten days or so, checking the soil to make sure that it’s properly drying out between sessions.

</br></br>

#### :seedling:  &nbsp; Soil
well-draining soil that has equally mixed parts of organic matter such as peat moss and perlite.

</br></br>

#### :yum:  &nbsp; Fertilizer
There’s no need to fertilize your Peperomia, but you can fertilize your plant in the spring or summer if you’d like it to grow a little faster.

Use any fertilizer made for indoor plants and follow the directions on the packaging. Leach the plant in summer by flushing with water to remove the salts left behind by fertilization.

</br></br>

#### :droplet: &nbsp; &nbsp; Humidity
Enjoy a misting from time to time

Misting the leaves once a week should suffice as long as you check that the soil hasn’t been doused in too much water.

#### :point_up:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-pot
Being slow growers, the need to move them to a bigger pot isn’t as dire. Interestingly enough, they really don’t care for being repotted too frequently. This will be seen in the deterioration of their foliage.

That bright pink color will shift to that of a faded pastel color. This does not mean, however, that you should avoid repotting your Tricolor plant if it has completely outgrown its current living situation.

You should expect to have to go through this process every two to three years during the warmer months.

</br></br>

#### :triumph:  &nbsp; Mature Height
The mature size of these plants is generally around 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) in both height and width.

</br></br>

#### :fire:  &nbsp; Temperature
Your Peperomia Ginny prefers temperatures between 60-80 degrees during the day and should not get colder than 55 degrees at night.
